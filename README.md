# FastGATE device tracker

Fastweb FastGATE [device tracker](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_tracker/)
to track home presence in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Based on [xiaomi device tracker](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/xiaomi/device_tracker.py)

## How it works

The intergration uses the API of the Fastgate web interface to obtain device information.

I am too lazy to explain here how information retrieval from the FastGate works.

Please refer to the Bash and Python scripts in the devel folder of this repository.

## Unmaintained

This repository will no longer be updated.

I no longer own the Fastgate as I have finally replaced it with an OpenWRT router within my home network.
