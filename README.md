# FASTGate device tracker

[Fastweb FASTGate](https://www.fastweb.it/myfastweb/assistenza/guide.php/FASTGate/) [device tracker](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/device_tracker/)
to track home presence in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

Based on [xiaomi device tracker](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/blob/dev/homeassistant/components/xiaomi/device_tracker.py)

## How it works

The intergration uses FASTGate's web interface API to obtain device information in JSON.

I'm too lazy to explain here how information retrieval from the FastGATE works.

Please refer to the Bash and Python scripts in the devel folder of this repository.

## Unmaintained

> [!WARNING]
> This repository will no be updated by me.\
> I no longer own the FASTGate as I've (finally) replaced it with an OpenWRT router.
